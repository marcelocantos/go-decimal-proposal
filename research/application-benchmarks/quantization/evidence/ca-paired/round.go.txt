// Mode is a rounding-direction attribute (IEEE 754-2019 clause 4.3). The
// five values are the five attributes of the standard; a Mode outside them
// behaves as ToNearestEven. The language operators use ToNearestEven only.
// See "Rounding modes" in the package documentation.

// Status reports the conditions met by a conversion: from a character
// sequence (Parse64, Parse128), to an integer (Int64From64 and its
// relatives), or from exact parts (Round64, Round128). It is a bit set; the
// zero value Exact means the result is the exact value. Arithmetic
// operations do not return a Status: they return the IEEE default result
// for every exception (clause 7) and nothing else. The conditions and
// their default results are defined in "Conditions" in the package
// documentation.

// Callers map a Status to their own error type. For example, a parser
// reports Syntax as a syntax error and Overflow as a range error, as
// strconv.ParseFloat does, and ignores Inexact and Underflow.

// Round64 is the rounding routine of the package, exposed for callers that
// hold an exact value in parts: the compiler encoding a constant whose
// exact value it has reduced, and the string parser. Every operation of
// the package reaches an encoding through this routine (round64 in
// zarith64.go, generated from roundW in arith_tmpl.go, whose comment is
// the contract for callers inside the package).
//
// The input describes the exact value v = (-1)^neg × (coeff + f) × 10^exp,
// where f is zero when sticky is false and an unspecified fraction with
// 0 < f < 1 when sticky is true. The coefficient may be any uint64 and the
// exponent any int. A caller holding more digits than fit keeps them in
// coeff as far as it can and folds the rest into sticky; a caller with an
// inexact value must keep at least one digit beyond the destination
// precision (a round digit) in coeff, because sticky records only that f
// is non-zero, not its size.
//
// The result is v rounded to decimal64 in the given mode, with the
// preferred exponent exp, under the rules of the package documentation
// ("Rounding from exact parts" and the sections it refers to), and the
// Status reports Inexact, Overflow and Underflow as they occur.

// roundUp reports whether a truncated magnitude is to be incremented by one
// unit in its last place: class is the class of the discarded part (never
// classZero; an exact value is not rounded), odd the parity of the
// truncated coefficient and neg the sign of the value (IEEE 754-2019
