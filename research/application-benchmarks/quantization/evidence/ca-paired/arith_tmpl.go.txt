// whose leading digit lies in a higher decimal place is the larger, whatever
// the coefficients, so values whose exponents differ by thousands of places
// are compared without scaling anything. Only when the adjusted exponents
// are equal are the coefficients aligned, and then the coefficient with the
// larger exponent has fewer digits than the other by exactly the difference
// of the exponents; scaling it up gives it the digit count of the other,
// which is at most PrecisionW, so the product cannot overflow and the

// roundW is the rounding routine of the package: the one function that

// and "Sign of a result" (for zeros) in the package documentation is
// implemented here and nowhere else. The width-independent direction
// decision is roundUp in round.go; the rest is this function.
//
// The input is the exact value
//
//	v = (-1)^neg × (p + f) × 10^exp
//
// with p a wide integer (the full product of two coefficients fits it) and
// f a fraction, 0 <= f < 1, described only by class: classZero for f = 0,
// otherwise where f lies relative to one half. floor is the least exponent
// the result may take: MinExpW for every operation with a preferred
// exponent (exp is then that preferred exponent), and the fixed exponent
// itself, equal to exp, for Quantize and RoundToIntegral, whose result
// exponent is fixed by the operation rather than by the precision; such a
// caller treats a result whose exponent is not exp as not fitting
// (Quantize returns NaN, RoundToIntegral keeps the carried value).
//
// What a caller must supply for the result to be correctly rounded:
//
//   - p and class together describe v exactly. A caller holding more
//     digits than p can carry (FMA, a quotient generated beyond the
//     precision, a sum whose operands are far apart) reduces them with the
//     digit primitives, cShiftFullW or cReduceClassW, and passes the class
//     they return as class; two reductions compose as digits.go says.
//   - If class is not classZero and stands for a fraction of unknown size,
//     p must have more than PrecisionW digits. roundW then discards at
//     least one digit of p itself, and withSticky combines the two
//     discarded parts exactly. A caller meets this by keeping PrecisionW+1
//     digits or more, or by scaling its exact part up to that many digits
//     before truncating the rest, or by passing the whole exact product, as
//     mulW does.
//   - If class is not classZero and p has PrecisionW digits or fewer, no
//     digit of p is discarded and class alone decides the rounding, taken
//     at face value: classHalf is a tie and classAboveHalf rounds up in the
//     nearest modes. Only roundPartsW passes such a class, and it passes
//     classBelowHalf, which is how RoundW's sticky bit means "p + ε for an
//     arbitrarily small ε > 0" ("Rounding from exact parts"); an operation
//     never does, since every operation keeps a round digit. A p of zero
//     with a non-zero class is a value below 10^exp, and a caller meaning
//     "arbitrarily small" passes exp <= MinExpW with it, as roundPartsW
//     does, so that it rounds at MinExpW.
//
// The result exponent x is exp for an exact value, raised when p has more
// than PrecisionW digits, when exp is below floor, or when exp is above
// MaxExpW and the coefficient can be padded with zeros to make up the
// difference (fold-down); if it cannot, the value overflows. An inexact
// value is encoded at the least exponent at or above floor at which its
// rounded coefficient has at most PrecisionW digits, so p is padded or
// shifted to that place before the increment, and a coefficient that
// carries out to 10^PrecisionW becomes 10^(PrecisionW-1) one place up. An
// exact zero takes exp clamped into [floor, MaxExpW] and keeps the sign.
//
// Status: Exact when the result is v, including an exact subnormal, an
// exact fold-down and a zero; Inexact otherwise; Inexact|Underflow when,
// in addition, v is non-zero and below 10^EminW (tininess before
// rounding); Inexact|Overflow when the rounded value is above the largest
// finite one, in which case the result is the infinity or the largest
// finite value of sign neg that overflowsToInf selects. The arithmetic
// wrappers discard the Status; it is meaningful to RoundW, to the parser
// and to the integer conversions, which report it.
//
// Exact fast paths. PackW is the raw encoder; it rounds nothing and
// refuses what does not fit. No function other than roundW may call it,
// unless it re-encodes a coefficient and exponent already known to be
// representable because UnpackW returned them, possibly with another
// sign or for a narrower width, decoded them from an encoding that cannot
// hold anything else, or accepts an integer type whose whole range fits,
// and is named both here and in the allowlist of TestRoundIsTheOnlyPacker,
// which parses the package source. Widen re-encodes the decimal64
// coefficient and exponent
// that Unpack64 returned as a decimal128 with Pack128, because every
// decimal64 value is a decimal128 value. It measured two to three times
// faster than the rounding routine on a 256-bit wide value. BIDFromDPD64
// and BIDFromDPD128 encode the coefficient and exponent of a DPD encoding,
// which has at most Precision digits (one in the combination field and
// three to each declet) and a biased exponent below 3 × 2^(ExpBits-2) (the
// combination field's two leading exponent bits are never 11), so that
// every DPD finite value is representable exactly; they are conversions
// between encodings, not operations, and round nothing. Int64To128 and
// Uint64To128 encode an exponent-zero magnitude below 2^64, which has at
// most 20 digits and therefore always fits Precision128's 34 digits.
