// This file is the template for zquant64.go and zquant128.go: the
// operations that fix or inspect the exponent of a result rather than
// compute a new value, namely RoundToIntegral, Quantize, Reduce,
// SameQuantum and Quantum. It is written in the vocabulary of "Width parameterisation"
// in the package documentation (see arith_tmpl.go for the rules). Nothing
// here rounds by itself: the first two hand their exact value to roundW,
// with its floor parameter set to the fixed exponent of the result, which is
// why they need no second rounding routine.
package bid

// roundToIntegralW rounds the decimal x to an integral value in mode. The
// result exponent is max(Q(x), 0) whether or not a fraction was discarded
// (see "Exponent of a result"), which is exactly what roundW produces with
// floor 0: for Q(x) < 0 the value has fewer than PrecisionW integer digits,
// so the least exponent at which the coefficient fits is the floor, and the
// digits below it are dropped and rounded; for Q(x) >= 0 nothing is
// dropped and the exact value is re-encoded at its own exponent, which also
// canonicalizes a non-canonical finite encoding. A zero keeps its sign and
// takes exponent max(Q(x), 0). A NaN gives that NaN made quiet and an
// infinity is returned unchanged.

//
// When x has the larger exponent its coefficient is scaled up by the
// difference; roundW has nothing to round then (a coefficient padded to
// PrecisionW digits or fewer at the exponent of y is already the result)
// but it is the one function that encodes a result. When x has the smaller
// exponent, roundW drops the digits below the exponent of y, with floor
// that exponent. Dropping at least one digit leaves at most PrecisionW-1
// digits, so rounding up cannot carry out of the coefficient, and
// an x so small that every digit is dropped rounds to zero or to one unit,
// whatever the distance. An exact zero takes the exponent of y.
